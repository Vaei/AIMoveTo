# OBSOLETE

Do not use this branch. It exists for historic reasons, the PR accepted for 5.3 met the requirements and this was merged into `main` already.

This branch can only be used if Epic accepts [this pull request](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/pull/10528) making necessary changes
UPDATE: Accepted for 5.3, for 5.3 onwards this branch will be used.
