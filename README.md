# AIMoveTo
Adds AIMoveTo node but with additional parameters

This is a temporary solution, the `future` branch contains the correct solution, however it can only be used if Epic accepts [this pull request](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/pull/10528) making necessary changes. If the PR isn't accepted, and Epic start using the node cache in a later release, this node will become unusable. **UPDATE:** Accepted for 5.3, for 5.3 onwards the `future` branch will be used.
